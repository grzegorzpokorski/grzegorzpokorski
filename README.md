# Hi! I'm Grzegorz Pokorski üëã
I'm a self-taught front-end developer driven by my passion for creating websites from scratch. I've always been fascinated by building something out of nothing ‚ú®
Currently I am focused on deeply understanding TypeScript. I am also a big fan of Next.js framework because it enables me to create lightning-fast and high-performing websites that effectively achieve their business objectives.

In free time I love to contribute to the open source projects - that's the way how I learn new things, meet great people and also I partially fulfill as a developer by finding üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and fixing bugs üêõ what I really like do ‚ô•Ô∏è

Sometimes I write articles on [my personal blog](https://grzegorzpokorski.pl/blog/) where I share some of my thoughts and knowledge about web development.

Feel free to contact me via [e-mail](mailto:mr.pokorski@gmail.com). You can also find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grzegorz-pokorski/) or [Discord](https://discord.com/) (username: grzegorzpokorski). I'm **always happy** to hear from **YOU!** üòä
